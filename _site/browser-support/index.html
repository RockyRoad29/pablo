<h2 id='id1'><code>Pablo.isSupported</code></h2>

<p>Boolean <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, denoting whether or not the current browser supports the web technologies required by Pablo.</p>

<pre><code>if (Pablo.isSupported){
    alert(&#39;Pablo works!&#39;);
}
else {
    alert(&#39;Not supported!&#39;);
}</code></pre>

<p>Use this check in unknown environments to ensure that Pablo-specific code is only executed if the browser supports it.</p>

<p>Some discrepancies between browsers are supported, but Pablo&#8217;s code is kept lean by targeting only modern desktop and mobile browsers. The browser must provide <a href='http://caniuse.com/#search=svg'>basic SVG support</a>, as well as some <a href='http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/'>ECMAScript5 features</a> (the browsers that support SVG also usually support ECMAScript5). Pablo exits gracefully in non-supported browsers.</p>
