# Pablo

**For full documentation and interactive examples, see [pablojs.com][pablo-site].**


**[Pablo][pablo-site]** is a tool for creating crisp, interactive graphics and animations for the web. It is a lightweight and low-level JavaScript library for building user interfaces, data visualisations, responsive graphics and games.

Pablo is built on top of SVG ([scalable vector graphics][svg]), allowing graphics to be incorporated into websites and scripted from within web apps. It focusses on simplicity and performance, targeting modern browsers for both desktop and mobile.

Its API style is inspired by [jQuery][jquery]. The way it can manipulate collections of SVG elements is similar to [Underscore][_] and the expressive way it creates shapes is inspired by [RaphaÃ«l][raphael]. It aims to be lean, weighing in at only 5KB, and has no other JavaScript dependencies.


## Pablo and SVG

Pablo gives access to all of SVG's granularity and power, and can create anything that SVG can. Its methods are named after SVG elements, so a hand-in-hand knowledge of SVG is needed to get the most out of Pablo.
